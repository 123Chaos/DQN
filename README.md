*Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory, Fall, 2022*
================

- This project is based on [wetliu/dqn_pytorch: DQN with pytorch with on Breakout and SpaceInvaders (github.com)](https://github.com/wetliu/dqn_pytorch)

Some improvements and descriptions are as followed: 

- Pre-train the two models under the folder `models`

- The Dueling-DQN and DQN algorithms are respectively implemented and the suitability of the two algorithms for greedy strategies is compared.

- Sometimes, there may be an ENDLESS play which is like `./assets/EndlessPlay.mp4`, so there is a counter for solving this problem.
